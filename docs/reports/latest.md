## Methodology notes

- **TPS:** Recent RPC performance samples: total transactions divided by total sample seconds.
- **Slot time:** Recent RPC performance samples: total sample seconds divided by sampled slots.
- **Anomalies:** Current observation compared with the rolling median of up to 48 prior snapshots, plus explicit validator safety thresholds.
- **Health score:** Availability, slot performance, validator participation, and source coverage; diagnostic, not a protocol guarantee.
